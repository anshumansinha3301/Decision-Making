### **1. Introduction to Information, Computer, and Network Security**

#### **a. Information Security**
- Focuses on safeguarding information assets from unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, destruction, or alteration.
- Core Goals: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad).

#### **b. Computer Security**
- Protects individual computer systems and devices from malicious attacks, software failures, and data loss.
- Key Concerns:
  - Hardware protection (preventing theft or damage).
  - Software security (preventing malware infections).
  - Data security (ensuring backups and encryption).

#### **c. Network Security**
- Protects the communication infrastructure (wired and wireless networks) from intrusions, misuse, and disruption.
- Techniques used:
  - Firewalls
  - Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
  - Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

### **2. Security Concepts**

#### **a. Kinds of Security Breaches**
1. **Unauthorized Access**: Gaining access to systems or data without permission.
   - Example: Hacking into a database to steal sensitive customer information.
2. **Data Theft**: Extracting confidential or proprietary information without permission.
   - Example: Stealing intellectual property or trade secrets.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading a system to make it unavailable to legitimate users.
4. **Insider Threats**: Malicious activities carried out by employees, contractors, or other insiders.
5. **Malware Infection**: Introducing malicious software (e.g., viruses, ransomware, spyware) into a system.

#### **b. Threats and Risks**
- **Threats**: Any event or circumstance with the potential to cause harm.
  - Examples: Cyberattacks, natural disasters, hardware failures.
- **Risks**: Likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
  - Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact.

#### **c. Point of Vulnerability**
- Weak spots or potential points of failure in a system that attackers exploit.
- Examples:
  - Outdated software with unpatched vulnerabilities.
  - Weak passwords used by employees.
  - Misconfigured servers or open ports.

### **3. Types of Attacks**

#### **a. Passive Attacks**
- Aim: To gather information without altering the data or system.
- Examples:
  - **Eavesdropping**: Intercepting communication to gather sensitive data.
  - **Traffic Analysis**: Observing network traffic patterns to infer information.

#### **b. Active Attacks**
- Aim: To modify, disrupt, or destroy data or systems.
- Examples:
  - **Masquerade**: Impersonating an authorized user or device.
  - **Replay Attacks**: Capturing and reusing valid communication packets.
  - **Modification of Messages**: Altering legitimate data in transit.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Flooding a system with excessive requests to make it unavailable.

### **4. Security Services**

#### **a. Confidentiality**
- Ensures information is only accessible to authorized users.
- Techniques:
  - Encryption (e.g., AES, RSA).
  - Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS).

#### **b. Authentication**
- Verifies the identity of a user or system.
- Types:
  - Password-based authentication.
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Biometrics (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition).

#### **c. Non-Repudiation**
- Guarantees that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their actions.
- Achieved through:
  - Digital signatures.
  - Transaction logs.

#### **d. Integrity**
- Ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and has not been tampered with.
- Techniques:
  - Hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256, MD5).
  - Checksums.

#### **e. Access Control**
- Regulates who can view, modify, or execute resources in a system.
- Methods:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Discretionary access control (DAC).

#### **f. Availability**
- Ensures that systems, applications, and data are accessible when needed.
- Techniques:
  - Redundancy (e.g., backup servers, RAID).
  - Load balancing.
  - Protection against DoS attacks.

### **5. Model for Internetwork Security**

#### **a. Components**
1. **Policies**: Define acceptable behavior, rules, and procedures.
2. **Mechanisms**: Tools and methods used to enforce policies.
3. **Assurance**: Confidence that mechanisms are functioning as intended.

#### **b. Security Layers**
- **Application Layer**: User authentication, email security.
- **Transport Layer**: Data encryption using SSL/TLS.
- **Network Layer**: IP security, firewalls.
- **Data Link Layer**: Encryption at the frame level.

---

### **6. Internet Standards and RFCs**

#### **a. Internet Standards**
- Defined by organizations like the **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**.
- Cover protocols, data formats, and best practices for the internet.

#### **b. RFCs (Request for Comments)**
- Technical documents that specify internet standards.
- Examples of Important RFCs:
  - **RFC 791**: Internet Protocol (IP).
  - **RFC 1321**: MD5 Message Digest Algorithm.
  - **RFC 5246**: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol.
