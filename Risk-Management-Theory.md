Decision-making theories provide frameworks for understanding how individuals and organizations make choices, especially under conditions of risk and uncertainty. Here’s an overview of some key decision-making theories based on the provided search results:

### 1. **Bounded Rationality Decision-Making Theory**
Developed by Herbert A. Simon, this theory posits that while individuals aim to make rational decisions, their ability is limited by cognitive constraints and the availability of information. Instead of seeking the optimal solution, individuals often settle for a "satisficing" option—one that is good enough given the circumstances. This approach acknowledges that complete information is rarely available, leading to decisions that prioritize practicality over perfection [1][2].

### 2. **Vroom-Yetton Decision-Making Theory**
This model, created by Victor Vroom and Philip Yetton, emphasizes that there is no single best decision-making process; instead, the appropriate method depends on the specific situation. It incorporates a series of questions to determine whether a participative or autocratic approach is more suitable, allowing for flexibility in decision-making based on context [1].

### 3. **Intuitive Decision-Making Theory**
This theory suggests that decisions can often be made based on intuition rather than extensive analysis. It recognizes that experienced decision-makers may rely on gut feelings or instincts developed through past experiences. This approach can be particularly effective in fast-paced situations where time is limited [1].

### 4. **Expected Utility Theory**
A foundational concept in normative decision theory, expected utility theory posits that individuals make decisions by considering the expected outcomes of various choices and selecting the one with the highest anticipated value. This theory emphasizes rational choice under uncertainty and serves as a benchmark for evaluating decision-making processes [3].

### 5. **Risk Management and Decision-Making Theory**
This theory focuses on how rational individuals should behave under risk and uncertainty. It integrates risk assessment into the decision-making process, emphasizing the importance of evaluating potential risks associated with different alternatives before making a choice. This approach is particularly relevant in corporate settings where decisions can have significant financial implications [2].

### Conclusion
Understanding these decision-making theories equips individuals and organizations with tools to analyze their choices more effectively. By recognizing the limitations of human cognition (bounded rationality), adapting processes to specific situations (Vroom-Yetton), valuing intuitive insights, applying expected utility principles, and integrating risk management, decision-makers can enhance their ability to navigate complex scenarios and achieve better outcomes.
